Each of two die has colored faces, 3 green, 2 blue and 1 red. The two dice will be rolled. The outcome will be considered to be one “bingo call.” If you have this outcome on your bingo card, mark it off. The winner will be the student who gets a bingo card completely marked off (all 25 squares). We wish to find the optimal way to mark each square on the bingo card (use BG for “blue green,” BB for “blue blue,” etc.) so that we have the best chance of winning.
